# Sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews
Original Repository: https://github.com/ayyteng/NLP-Final-Project

The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how we have trained multiple classifiers to be able to perform a sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews. This paper will delve into how we have built and trained a Naive Bayes Multinomial classifier, Unigram and Bigram SVM classifier, and a Logistic Regression classifier. We divided a Kaggle dataset of 1,000 restaurant reviews tagged as positive (1) or negative (0) into 80% training data, 10% development data, and 10% test data [3]. The data has 500 positive reviews and 500 negative reviews. We found that the highest scoring algorithm was Unigram TF IDF SVM with 85% accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure score. We saw improvement of scores through pre-processing such as stemming and stop word removal. These classifiers provide a potential system for customer review web pages to be able to provide a summary of thousands of reviews for other customers or restaurant owners to see the general sentiment towards an establishment.
